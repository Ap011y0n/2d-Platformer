<h3> Forest Dash </h3>
Forrest Dash is a platformer videogame in which you control the main character and you have to surpass the levels quickly and dealing with a lot of enemies.
<h2>Description</h2>
For our second year at the Design and Development of videogames degree in the Videogames Development subject we had to make a platformer.
<h3>How it works & Innovations </h3>
Forest Dash is a platformer done with the SDL libraries, it is divided in many modules that control the most important aspects of the game such as Audio, Render, Levels, Entities, UI... the game is mostly made in C/C++, for
surpass the subject we had several requirements that we had to accomplish but we decided to do some off-requirements things, such as:
<dl>
  <dt>- Animations loaded from tmx</dt>
  <dt>- Checkpoints</dt>
  <dt>- Special Bow animations</dt>
  <dt>- Enemies created in tmx</dt>
  <dt>- Time bar</dt>
  <dt>- Colliders made in Tiled</dt>
</dl>
